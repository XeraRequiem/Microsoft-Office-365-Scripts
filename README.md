# Microsoft Office 365 Scripts
Standardizes the services under specific license. If the user doesnâ€™t have the license, then the user is given license with the standard set of services enabled. Standard set of services is given by McKinstry IT and is embedded within the script. To change the standard, change the hash table of enabled services within corresponding script.

To Use Script:
1. Open script in any text editor.
2. Replace the Username and Password with the Username and Password of your Admin account.
3. Replace TenantID with your company's Microsoft Online Id.
4. (Recommended) Replace each license's list of enabled services with your comapany's standard lists.
5. Execute script via PowerShell

The script can be used to update the enabled services of a single user, a list of users, or all users registered under company's Microsoft Id.
